# Secure File Storage

## 📌 Project Description
Secure File Storage is a decentralized smart-contract-based file metadata registry.  
Rather than storing the full file on-chain, the contract stores **encrypted file hashes or IPFS CIDs**, ensuring security, integrity, and trustless verifiability.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a lightweight, secure, and censorship-resistant decentralized file registry that can integrate with IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave, or other distributed storage systems—allowing individuals and dApps to manage encrypted file metadata transparently on-chain.

---

## ⭐ Key Features
- **File Uploading**  
  Users can store encrypted file hashes or URIs with a unique file ID.

- **File Updating**  
  Owners can update their file’s metadata (e.g., new version or re-encrypted data).

- **File Retrieval**  
  Anyone can fetch the file metadata and verify ownership or timestamp.

- **Ownership-Based Access Control**  
  Only the uploader of a file can modify it.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Role-based permission control** (shared access, multi-user editing).  
- **Integration with decentralized storage** (IPFS/Filecoin APIs).  
- **Version history tracking** for all file updates.  
- **Off-chain encryption support** with on-chain key management.  
- **UI dashboard** for uploading and retrieving files seamlessly.  
- **Enhanced metadata** (file size, type, tags).
